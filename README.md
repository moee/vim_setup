vim_setup
=========

Scripts to set up my vim environment on any machine. Right now it installs

* MRU
* pathogen.vim
* SnipMate along with some custom snippets

**Attention: This will overwrite your .vimrc without asking! You have been warned.**

`git clone https://github.com/moee/vim_setup.git ~/vim_setup && cd ~/vim_setup && ./setup.sh && cd .. && rm vim_setup -rf`
